# Readme

This repository houses the sample code for the Liferay Asset Framework blog series.

I'll include the links to each part here when they are published.

For a lack of a different plan, each blog part will be represented by a different branch of the repo.

So the blog for Part 1 will end up with a branch name of **part_1**.

Enjoy!
